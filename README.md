# Challenges We Faced And How We Solved Them

As it was the first time for us to collaborate remotely on a project. We faced quite a few challenges while developing the clone. The challenges we can remember are as follows:-
1.Another challenge was solving the problem of redundant CSS classes. It happened sometimes that there were few redundant classes and the output used to get disoriented. We overcame this challenge by setting rules and guidelines on how should we name our classes and functions so that they wonâ€™t interfere with each other.
2.There were some new design standards and features to be met, specifically on the home page of the website. So implementing that was a challenge, we have to make use of UI libraries to achieve the proper result.
3.Implementing functionalities such as the cart feature was somewhat of a challenge by itself.
